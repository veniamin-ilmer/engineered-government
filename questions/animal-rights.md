# Do Animals Have Rights?

Yes, but they are limited.

## Background

This question usually infers what humans are not allowed to do to animals. Not what animals are not allowed to do to other animals.

If an animal is attacked by another animal, there is no expectation that anything will be done to rectify the situation.

But if a human attacks an animal, then there is an expectation that the human should be restricted in some way.
