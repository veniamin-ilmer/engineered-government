# Is Taxation Theft?

Normally yes, but it doesn't have to be.

## Background

This question is usually asked by people who feel like they pay too many taxes and don't get enough government services in return.

They argue that the only reason they pay taxes is that the government is forcing them to do so. They argue that they have no choice in the matter, and wish they can do something to not have to pay so many taxes.

## Solution

The government should not tax any private transactions. That includes sales tax, income tax, and estate tax.

Instead, the government should collect money via use of government property. It should hence not be "tax", but rent.

Government property include land, air, and natural resource use.

Instead of selling land to private individuals, the government should "rent" it to them. The rent rate of any property should be auctioned to the highest bidder.

Same thing with air use (air pollution, noise pollution), that includes airplanes flying through the air.

As a consequence of never selling the land, but simply renting it out, "taxes" are never collected. People simply pay for use of government land. This way, the usual arguments against taxes are side-stepped.
