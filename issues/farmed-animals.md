## Solution

Although culture plays a role in meat consumption, economics is a major factor.

A big reason why people buy meat, is that it's relatively cheap.

Artificially cheap. Meat production is signficantly more expensive than plant production, and the main reason it is so cheap is because it is subsitized by the government.

If the government were to stop subsitizes for meat production (and levy tariffs against other countries that subsitize meat production), the true cost of growing meat would become apparent.

Less people would buy meat simply because of the price. This would result in much fewer farmed animals.
