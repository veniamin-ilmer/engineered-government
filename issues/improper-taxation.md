# Improper Taxation

## User Story

> It is unfair for the government to make me pay taxes off my private transactions.

> Because of sales and income taxes, I cannot sell as many items and can't hire as many people.

> Isn't the government always trying to get more people employed? Well income tax goes against that, because our small businesses can't afford to hire enough people with these income taxes.

> The government should find some other way to get taxes.

## Solution

Sales and income taxes are examples of [deadweight loss of taxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_burden_of_taxation), and can indeed cause unemployment, and higher prices.

In effort to combat this problem, the government should collect money via use of government property. It should hence not be "tax", but rent.

Government property include land, air, and natural resource use.

Instead of selling land to private individuals, the government should "rent" it to them. The rent rate of any property should be auctioned to the highest bidder.

Same thing with air use (air pollution, noise pollution), that includes airplanes flying through the air.

As a consequence of never selling the land, but simply renting it out, "taxes" are never collected. People simply pay for use of government land. This way, the usual arguments against taxes are side-stepped.

Private transactions are left untaxed.
