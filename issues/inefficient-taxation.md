## Solution

Sales and income taxes are examples of [deadweight loss of taxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excess_burden_of_taxation), and can indeed cause unemployment, and higher prices.

In effort to combat this problem, the government should collect money via use of government property. It should hence not be "tax", but rent.

Government property include land, air, and natural resource use.

Instead of selling land to private individuals, the government should "rent" it to them. The rent rate of any property should be auctioned to the highest bidder.

Same thing with air use (air pollution, noise pollution), that includes airplanes flying through the air.

As a consequence of never selling the land, but simply renting it out, "taxes" are never collected. People simply pay for use of government land. This way, the usual arguments against taxes are side-stepped.

Private transactions are left untaxed.

[Land Value Tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax), is known to be an [optimal tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_tax), due to it not increasing the price of the land, and instead encouraging development of the land as much as possible.
