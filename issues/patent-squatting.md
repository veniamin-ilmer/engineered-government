# Patent Squatting

## User Story

> Filing a patent is too expensive for an average inventor.
> That's why inventors and small companies try and go into business without initially filing a patent.
>
> Patent trolls take advantage of this by making a patent for an *existing product*, then demand companies that make this product to pay royalities.
>
> The patent is active for about 20 years, giving companies exclusive monopolies, allowing them to charge as much as they want for this product.
>
> Filing patents should be a much cheaper, easier process that an average inventor can do.
>
> We need to stop trolls from being able to squat on thousands of patents, praying on small companies.
>
> The 20 years is too arbitrary. Some patents should last for shorter times, some for longer, depending on the situation.

## Solution

We need to change how patents work. You should never "own" a patent. Rather, you would "rent" a patent from the government.

The rent should initially be very cheap. Cheap enough for any inventor to afford on their own, and not need to depend on an organization.

However, the rent should increase non-linearly (exponentially?) over time.

The intention here is to limit patent squatting. After a few years, it should be too expensive to afford holding on to a patent without using it.

Only the most financially viable patents would continue to be rented out over the years. Otherwise, most other patents would expire rather quickly.
