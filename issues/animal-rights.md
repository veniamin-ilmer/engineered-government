# Do Animals Have Rights?

Yes, but they are limited.

## Background

This question usually infers what humans are not allowed to do to animals. Not what animals are not allowed to do to other animals.

If an animal is attacked by another animal, there is no expectation that anything will be done to rectify the situation.

But there is an expectation that humans should be limited in how they treat animals. To limit harm against animals.

This is understandable for wild animals or pets. But what about animals that humans raise purposely to be eaten?

A vegetarian diet is not the most healthy diet. Meat and dairy provides vitamin B12, Iron, and other micronutrients that may be difficult to get with vegetables alone.

## Solution

First, to cover the simpler case:

Wild animals should be able to live in an environment that excludes humans.

Some kind of nature reserve.

For the harder case:

I've talked with several vegetarians about this issue to understand their perspective.

Farm animals have been bred so much, that they would not be able to survive on their own in the wild.

Yet, these animals feel pain.

We're pretty much in a cornered situation.

We've bred these animals to only be able to live, to be slaughtered.
